# Principles-of-Cybersecurity
Completed course labs 

This repository contains a collection of labs that highlight my growing expertise in cybersecurity. The labs are organized into three sections, each demonstrating a different level of proficiency and independence:

Section 1: Guided Work - This section includes labs where I closely followed the provided instructions. The deliverables for these labs are screenshots that demonstrate the successful completion of each task.

Section 2: Semi-Guided Work - In this section, the labs required me to apply the concepts learned with less guidance. The deliverables here vary, showcasing my ability to adapt and apply my knowledge in different contexts.

Section 3: Independent Work - The labs in this section represent my ability to work independently. These labs were completed without any guidance, and the deliverables are a testament to my problem-solving skills and understanding of the subject matter.

Through these labs, I have not only learned valuable cybersecurity skills but also demonstrated my ability to learn and adapt in varying levels of guidance and complexity. I hope you find this work informative and indicative of my dedication and passion for cybersecurity.
